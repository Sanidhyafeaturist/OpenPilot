# OpenPilot

## Description
This autopilot framework is designed for controlling toy cars, drones, and boats. It integrates various sensors, communication modules, and control algorithms to provide autonomous navigation and operation. The framework is modular, allowing for easy expansion and customization through plugins.

## Features
- Supports various vehicles: toy cars, drones, and boats.
- Modular architecture for easy addition of new sensors and communication methods.
- Plugin support for extended functionality.
- Real-time sensor data processing and control algorithms.

## Installation

### Requirements
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi or similar mini computer.
- **Software**: Raspberry Pi OS or any Linux-based OS.
- **Libraries**: Necessary libraries for GPIO, I2C, SPI, etc.

### Installation Steps
 Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sanidhyafeaturist/OpenPilot.git
   cd yourproject
```

## Usage

### Getting Started
- Connect your sensors and actuators according to the provided wiring diagrams.
- Modify configuration files if necessary to set your specific parameters.

### Example Code
Here is a basic example of how to use the framework:

```cpp
#include "framework/control.h"
#include "framework/sensors.h"

int main() {
    Sensors sensors;
    Control control;

    sensors.initialize();
    control.initialize();

    while (true) {
        auto data = sensors.read();
        control.execute(data);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Connecting Sensors and Actuators
Refer to the `docs` directory for wiring diagrams and pin mappings for your sensors and actuators.

### Compiling the code
To compile the code ensure you have g++ installed:

```bash
g++ yourfile.cpp -o youroutputfile.bin
```

### Executing the code:

now, place the output code on an usb and the activator script from startup folder and place them on the same usb.
then connect the usb to raspberry pi.

### Contribution
Contributions are welcomed, But Be very sure to submit quality code only. Refer to Code Of conduct for more details.
